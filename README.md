This was a 4 person project but since they are not maintaining a GitHub Repository I can not add them as contributor. But it is possible to find their name in the submitted report.
My role in this project was to develop 5 parts, Wheel and Axle Sub Assembly, Final Assembly, create all the draftings and maintaining the repository of this project.
All the required files can be obtained in the repository.
